 	bioconductor-qusage	This package is an implementation the Quantitative Set Analysis for Gene Expression (QuSAGE) method described in (Yaari G. et al, Nucl Acids Res, 2013). This is a novel Gene Set Enrichment-type test, which is designed to provide a faster, more accurate, and easier to understand test for gene expression studies. qusage accounts for inter-gene correlations using the Variance Inflation Factor technique proposed by Wu et al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2012). In addition, rather than simply evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a single number (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a complete probability density function (PDF). From this PDF, P values and confidence intervals can be easily extracted. Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc analysis (e.g., pair-wise comparisons of gene set activity) while maintaining statistical traceability. Finally, while qusage is compatible with individual gene statistics from existing methods (e.g., LIMMA), a Welch-based method is implemented that is shown to improve specificity. For questions, contact Chris Bolen (cbolen1@gmail.com) or Steven Kleinstein (steven.kleinstein@yale.edu)	http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.5/bioc/html/qusage.html

The local FDR measures the posterior probability the null hypothesis is true given the test's p-value. Various plots are automatically generated, allowing one to make sensible significance cut-offs. Several mathematical results have recently been shown on the conservative accuracy of the estimated q-values from this software. The software can be applied to problems in genomics, brain imaging, astrophysics, and data mining.	https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/qvalue.html

Roleswitch operates in two phases by inferring the probability of mRNA (miRNA) being the targets (""targets"") of miRNA (mRNA), taking into account the expression of all of the mRNAs (miRNAs) due to their potential competition for the same miRNA (mRNA). Due to dynamic miRNA repression in the cell, Roleswitch assumes that the total transcribed mRNA levels are higher than the observed (equilibrium) mRNA levels and iteratively updates the total transcription of each mRNA targets based on the above inference.

 	bioconductor-snphood	To date, thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be associated with complex traits and diseases. However, the vast majority of these disease-associated SNPs lie in the non-coding part of the genome, and are likely to affect regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, rather than function of a protein. Thus, to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic traits and diseases, it becomes increasingly important to study the effect of a SNP on nearby molecular traits such as chromatin environment or transcription factor (TF) binding. Towards this aim, we developed SNPhood, a user-friendly *Bioconductor* R package to investigate and visualize the local neighborhood of a set of SNPs of interest for NGS data such as chromatin marks or transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-Seq or RNA- Seq experiments. SNPhood comprises a set of easy-to-use functions to extract, normalize and summarize reads for a genomic region, perform various data quality checks, normalize read counts using additional input files, and to cluster and visualize the regions according to the binding pattern. The regions around each SNP can be binned in a user-defined fashion to allow for analysis of very broad patterns as well as a detailed investigation of specific binding shapes. Furthermore, SNPhood supports the integration with genotype information to investigate and visualize genotype-specific binding patterns. Finally, SNPhood can be employed for determining, investigating, and visualizing allele-specific binding patterns around the SNPs of interest.	http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.5/bioc/html/SNPhood.html

 	bioconductor-sscu	The package calculates the indexes for selective stength in codon usage in bacteria species. (1) The package can calculate the strength of selected codon usage bias (sscu, also named as s_index) based on Paul Sharp's method. The method take into account of background mutation rate, and focus only on four pairs of codons with universal translational advantages in all bacterial species. Thus the sscu index is comparable among different species. (2) The package can detect the strength of translational accuracy selection by Akashi's test. The test tabulating all codons into four categories with the feature as conserved/variable amino acids and optimal/non-optimal codons. (3) Optimal codon lists (selected codons) can be calculated by either op_highly function (by using the highly expressed genes compared with all genes to identify optimal codons), or op_corre_CodonW/op_corre_NCprime function (by correlative method developed by Hershberg & Petrov). Users will have a list of optimal codons for further analysis, such as input to the Akashi's test. (4) The detailed codon usage information, such as RSCU value, number of optimal codons in the highly/all gene set, as well as the genomic gc3 value, can be calculate by the optimal_codon_statistics and genomic_gc3 function. (5) Furthermore, we added one test function low_frequency_op in the package.

The method of moment (MM) estimates for dispersion are shrunk towards an estimated target, which minimizes the average squared difference between the shrinkage estimates and the initial estimates. The exact per-gene probability under the NB model is calculated, and used to test the hypothesis that the expected expression of a gene in two conditions identically follow a NB distribution.	http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.5/bioc/html/sSeq.html

 	bioconductor-twilight	In a typical microarray setting with gene expression data observed under two conditions, the local false discovery rate describes the probability that a gene is not differentially expressed between the two conditions given its corrresponding observed score or p-value level. The resulting curve of p-values versus local false discovery rate offers an insight into the twilight zone between clear differential and clear non-differential gene expression. Package 'twilight' contains two main functions: Function twilight.pval performs a two-condition test on differences in means for a given input matrix or expression set and computes permutation based p-values. Function twilight performs a stochastic downhill search to estimate local false discovery rates and effect size distributions. The package further provides means to filter for permutations that describe the null distribution correctly. Using filtered permutations, the influence of hidden confounders could be diminished.	http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.5/bioc/html/twilight.html

 	r-mixomics	Multivariate methods are well suited to large omics data sets where the number ofvariables (e.g. genes, proteins, metabolites) is much larger than the number ofsamples (patients, cells, mice). They have the appealing properties of reducingthe dimension of the data by using instrumental variables (components), which aredefined as combinations of all variables. Those components are then used to produceuseful graphical outputs that enable better understanding of the relationships andcorrelation structures between the different data sets that are integrated. mixOmicsoffers a wide range of multivariate methods for the exploration and integrationof biological datasets with a particular focus on variable selection. The packageproposes several sparse multivariate models we have developed to identify the keyvariables that are highly correlated, and/or explain the biological outcome of interest.The data that can be analysed with mixOmics may come from high throughput sequencingtechnologies, such as omics data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, metagenomicsetc) but also beyond the realm of omics (e.g. spectral imaging). The methods implementedin mixOmics can also handle missing values without having to delete entire rowswith missing data. A non exhaustive list of methods include generalised CanonicalCorrelation Analysis, sparse Partial Least Squares and sparse Discriminant Analysis.Recently we implemented integrative methods to combine multiple data sets: horizontalintegration with regularised Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis and verticalintegration with multi-group Partial Least Squares.	http://www.mixOmics.org

A promising experimental tool for profiling sense and antisense transcription is strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq). To identify cis-NATs using ssRNA-seq, we developed a new computational method based on model comparison that incorporates the inherent variable efficiency of generating perfectly strand-specific libraries. Applying the method to new ssRNA-seq data from whole root and cell-type specific Arabidopsis libraries confirmed most of the known cis-NAT pairs and identified hundreds of additional cis-NAT pairs.	https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/NASTIseq_104/

It also parses the model output and contains summary and plotting functions for exploration of the results. In addition, solarius enables parallel computing of the linkage and association analyses, that makes the calculation of genome-wide scans more efficient. See <http://solar.txbiomedgenetics.org/> for more information about SOLAR.	https://github.com/ugcd/solarius
 	r-speaq	We introduce a novel suite of informatics tools for the quantitative analysis of NMR metabolomic profile data. The core of the processing cascade is a novel peak alignment algorithm, called hierarchical Cluster-based Peak Alignment (CluPA). The algorithm aligns a target spectrum to the reference spectrum in a top-down fashion by building a hierarchical cluster tree from peak lists of reference and target spectra and then dividing the spectra into smaller segments based on the most distant clusters of the tree. To reduce the computational time to estimate the spectral misalignment, the method makes use of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) cross-correlation. Since the method returns a high-quality alignment, we can propose a simple methodology to study the variability of the NMR spectra. For each aligned NMR data point the ratio of the between-group and within-group sum of squares (BW-ratio) is calculated to quantify the difference in variability between and within predefined groups of NMR spectra. This differential analysis is related to the calculation of the F-statistic or a one-way ANOVA, but without distributional assumptions. Statistical inference based on the BW-ratio is achieved by bootstrapping the null distribution from the experimental data. See Vu et al. (2011)<DOI:10.1186/1471-2105-12-405> for further information.	https://github.com/nghiavtr/speaq

x	r-xnomial	Tests whether a set of counts fit a given expected ratio. For example, a genetic cross might be expected to produce four types in the relative frequencies of 9:3:3:1. To see whether a set of observed counts fits this expectation, one can examine all possible outcomes with xmulti() or a random sample of them with xmonte() and find the probability of an observation deviating from the expectation by at least as much as the observed. As a measure of deviation from the expected, one can use the log-likelihood ratio, the multinomial probability, or the classic chi-square statistic. A histogram of the test statistic can also be plotted and compared with the asymptotic curve.	https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XNomial/index.html
